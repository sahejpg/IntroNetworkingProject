# CS2200 Project 5: Networking

## Project Description

This project, part of the CS2200 course, focuses on enhancing the transport layer of a simulated network to improve reliability. The key tasks include the implementation of threading in the network, segmentation and reassembly of messages into packets, understanding and applying checksums, and implementing a Reliable Transport Protocol (RTP) using the Stop-and-Wait protocol with ACK and NACK acknowledgements.

## Key Features

- **Threading in OS Network Implementation:** Enhancing concurrency in network operations.
- **Segmentation and Reassembly:** Breaking down messages into packets and vice versa.
- **Checksum Implementation:** Ensuring data integrity during transmission.
- **Stop-and-Wait Protocol:** Implementing reliable data transfer with ACK/NACK acknowledgements.
- **RTP (Reliable Transport Protocol):** Custom protocol development for reliable data transfer.

## Files

- `rtp.c`: Main implementation file for the RTP protocol.
- `rtp.h`: Header file with necessary fields for the RTP connection structure.
